Hypertension (HTN or HT), also known as high blood pressure (HBP), is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.
High blood pressure typically does not cause symptoms.
Lifestyle changes and medications can lower blood pressure and decrease the risk of health complications.
Lifestyle changes include weight loss, physical exercise, decreased salt intake, reducing alcohol intake, and a healthy diet.
If lifestyle changes are not sufficient then blood pressure medications are used.
